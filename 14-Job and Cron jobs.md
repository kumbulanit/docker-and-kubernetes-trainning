### Practical Exercise: Working with Jobs and CronJobs in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, **Jobs** and **CronJobs** are used to manage batch and scheduled tasks, respectively.

- **Job**: A Kubernetes resource that ensures a specified number of pods successfully terminate, typically used for one-time tasks.
- **CronJob**: A Kubernetes resource that runs jobs on a scheduled basis, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system.

This practical example will walk you through how to deploy both **Jobs** and **CronJobs**, as well as how to test them.

### **1. Job Example: Run a Simple Batch Task**

Let's create a simple job that runs a script to simulate a batch task. This job will run a simple "Hello World" echo command and then terminate.

#### **Step 1: Create a Job Definition**

1. **Create the job definition file (`job-example.yaml`)**:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: hello-world-job
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hello-world
          image: busybox
          command: ["echo", "Hello, Kubernetes!"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

This job will run the `echo` command once and terminate.

#### **Step 2: Apply the Job**

Now, apply the job definition to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f job-example.yaml
```

#### **Step 3: Verify Job Status**

You can check the status of the job and the associated pods by running:

```bash
kubectl get jobs
kubectl get pods -l app=hello-world
```

Once the job finishes, the pod will terminate. You can also describe the job to see its completion:

```bash
kubectl describe job hello-world-job
```

#### **Step 4: Check Logs**

To see the output of the job, you can check the logs of the pod that was created by the job:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

For example:

```bash
kubectl logs hello-world-job-xxxxxx
```

Once the job completes, you will see the message `Hello, Kubernetes!` in the logs.

### **2. CronJob Example: Run a Job on a Schedule**

A **CronJob** is used to run jobs on a schedule, similar to the cron utility in Linux. We will create a CronJob to run the same "Hello World" job every minute.

#### **Step 1: Create a CronJob Definition**

1. **Create the CronJob definition file (`cronjob-example.yaml`)**:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello-world-cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"  # Run every minute
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: hello-world-cronjob
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hello-world-cronjob
              image: busybox
              command: ["echo", "Hello, Kubernetes from CronJob!"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

In this example:
- The `schedule` field defines the cron expression. `"*/1 * * * *"` means "run every minute".
- The job created by the CronJob will execute a simple `echo` command and print a message.

#### **Step 2: Apply the CronJob**

Now, apply the CronJob definition:

```bash
kubectl apply -f cronjob-example.yaml
```

#### **Step 3: Verify CronJob Status**

To verify the CronJob is running and the jobs it generates, you can use:

```bash
kubectl get cronjobs
kubectl get jobs --selector=job-name=hello-world-cronjob
kubectl get pods -l app=hello-world-cronjob
```

You will see the jobs being created and completed based on the schedule.

#### **Step 4: Check Logs of a Pod**

To view the logs of the CronJob's pod and confirm the output:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

You should see the output: `Hello, Kubernetes from CronJob!`.

### **3. Testing and Verifying Job and CronJob**

#### **Step 1: Manually Trigger a CronJob**

If you want to manually trigger a CronJob job, you can create a one-off job from the CronJob's template:

```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/hello-world-cronjob hello-world-manual
```

Verify the job:

```bash
kubectl get jobs
kubectl get pods -l job-name=hello-world-manual
```

Check the logs for the manually triggered job:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

#### **Step 2: Clean Up Resources**

Once you've tested the Job and CronJob, you can delete the resources:

```bash
kubectl delete job hello-world-job
kubectl delete cronjob hello-world-cronjob
```

---

### **Conclusion**

In this exercise, we created two types of Kubernetes resources:

1. **Job**: A one-time task that runs and terminates when complete. We created a job to run an echo command as a batch task.
2. **CronJob**: A scheduled task that runs jobs at specified times, similar to cron on Linux. We scheduled a job to run every minute.
